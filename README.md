SpreeMailChimp
==============

h3. Configuration

See the Mail Chimp Settings forms in the Admin under Configuration.

Note, using Mail Chimp "Merge Vars", you can have any callable methods on User sent
to the MC list, mapped to indentically named (but uppercased) fields in the MC list admin console. 
Unfortunately these are only sent at the time the subscription is created, so there isn't much available.
